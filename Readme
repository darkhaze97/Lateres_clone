This game is a clone of breakout. You simply move the player paddle to hit a ball, which will bounce off it. Your goal is to destroy
all the blocks at the top of the screen. 

To move the paddle, you have to use the left and right arrow keys. 

Please note that the "you win" and "gameover" screens are not created by me, and the credit for these images go to the rightful creators.

Also, any feedback would be greatly appreciated :) I am a novice programmer and I want to improve my skills in coding!
